the gimmick to draw with Processing, Arduino and (of course) a pen. Semi-automatic drawer. Two mice to print images from monitor

assembled and hacked from: http://creativecomputing.cc/p5libs/procontroll/index.htm http://foxssic.wordpress.com/2007/02/06/dual-mouse-control-in-processing/ Sine Wave Signal - by Damien Di Fede.

before running on linux:

    allow procontroll library to read the mice input copy and paste to terminal ---> sudo chmod go=u /dev/input/event*

    allow processing to read the serial data from arduino copy and paste to terminal ---> sudo ln -s /dev/ttyACM0 /dev/ttyS42
